# Low-vol-anomaly-Trading-Strategy
Multi-factor investor Pim van Vliet created a low-vol related portfolio that has proved to beat high-vol portfolio return in long-term.  
This project is intended to validate (backtesting) the strategy in U.S. stock market and then to explore the rationale behind it. 
Our hypothesis is there are significant ghost effects from the super big guys like MSFT and GE that mislead the empirical results. 
We tested this hypothesis by examining the skewness and kurtosis of the low-vol portfolio, then we will move on to test and optimize the rebalancing frequencies of the portfolio to get higher retuns.
